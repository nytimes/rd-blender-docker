## Getting started
The images in this repository are autogenerated by running the `generate.py` script. The script uses `manifest.json` image definitions to define different versions and capabilities.
### If you just want to use one of the images in your Dockerfile
It should look like something like
```docker
FROM nytimes/blender:latest
```
For all tags available see [Docker tags](#docker-tags)

> If you are running a GPU image make sure you [follow and setup Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
